TODO:
	now:
		- adding brake H-bridge configuration ports to USB4702 (brakes engine is not working for now)
		- alert brake rework
		- stats gathering update
		- making FakeCarModel working like real model (Kubon???)
		- starting sequence (using IsInitialized()) + some barier to sync everything
		- making moving backward possible!

	future:
		- real time charts drawing (from gathered stats) (it would make regulators tuning much easier)
